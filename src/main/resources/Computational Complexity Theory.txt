P = {problems that can be solved in polynomial time}
Polynomial time = this time is a simple polynomial function of the size of the input.

A polynomial function is a function such as a quadratic, a cubic, a quartic, and so on,
 involving only non-negative integer powers of x. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 We can give a general defintion of a polynomial, and define its degree.
