A.K.A Union Find.

    Have a bunch of nodes.

    some of which are connected.

    is there a path between two given nodes?

    what/which groups of nodes are connected

    it lets us find if two things are connected.


    think sets/disjoint sets
    OPS:

    Makeset: add objects to the datastructure
    union: link objects together
    Find: are objects connected?

       A disjoint-set forest consists of a number of elements each of which stores an id, a parent pointer, and,
       in efficient algorithms, either a size or a "rank" value.

       The parent pointers of elements are arranged to form one or more trees, each representing a set. If an element's
       parent pointer points to no other element, then the element is the root of a tree and is the representative member
       of its set. A set may consist of only a single element. However, if the element has a parent, the element is part
       of whatever set is identified by following the chain of parents upwards until a representative element
       (one without a parent) is reached at the root of the tree.

       Forests can be represented compactly in memory as arrays in which parents are indicated by their array index.


       Disjoint-set data structures model the partitioning of a set, for example to keep track of the connected components
       of an undirected graph. This model can then be used to determine whether two vertices belong to the same component,
       or whether adding an edge between them would result in a cycle.
       The Unionâ€“Find algorithm is used in high-performance implementations of unification.
