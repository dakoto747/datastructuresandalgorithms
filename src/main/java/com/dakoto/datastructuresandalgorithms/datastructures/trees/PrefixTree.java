public class PrefixTree {
/*
Symbol tables with string keys. Could use standard symbol table implementation. Instead, exploit additional structure of string keys.
Customized searching algorithms for strings (and other keys represented as digits). Goal: as fast as hashing, more flexible
than binary search trees. Can efficiently support additional operations including prefix and wildcard matching,
e.g., IP routing table wants to forward to 128.112.136.12, instead forwards to 128.112 which is longest matching prefix
that it knows about. Side benefit: fast and space-efficient string searching.
